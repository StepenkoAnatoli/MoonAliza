# Best Open Source LLMs in 2026

![Roshan Desai](https://onyx.app/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Frd-ghibli-pfp.png&w=64&q=75)

By Roshan Desai

Two years ago, using an open-source LLM for serious work meant accepting a meaningful capability gap versus GPT-4 or Claude. That's no longer true. In 2026, MIT-licensed models like DeepSeek-V4-Pro and Kimi K2.6 now approach proprietary frontier models on several coding and reasoning benchmarks. For teams with data privacy requirements, the need to fine-tune on their own data, or the desire to avoid recurring API costs, the open-source tier is now a viable primary choice, not just a fallback.

This guide covers the top 10 open-source and open-weight LLMs from the [Onyx Open LLM Leaderboard](https://onyx.app/open-llm-leaderboard), updated as of July 20, 2026.

**How this guide is sourced:** Licensing, benchmark, parameter, and API availability data comes from the Onyx Open LLM Leaderboard. The recommendations in each section are editorial guidance for teams comparing open-source and open-weight options.

* * *

> **TL;DR:** Open-source LLMs have closed most of the gap with proprietary models for coding and reasoning tasks. **DeepSeek-V4-Pro** and **Kimi K2.6** are the two strongest picks: DeepSeek-V4-Pro leads on SWE-bench Verified and LiveCodeBench under an MIT license, while Kimi K2.6 posts a 90.5% GPQA Diamond, second only to GLM-5.2's 91.2% in this snapshot. For teams that need Apache 2.0 licensing, **Qwen3.6-27B** is a strong reasoning and coding option that runs on a single RTX 4090. If you want a cheap hosted API rather than self-hosting, **DeepSeek-V4-Flash** at $0.14/M input is the best reference point. For teams that want to run a capable model on modest hardware, **Gemma 4 31B** is the practical choice. Moonshot's **Kimi K3** is already live via API with Arena Elo 1,486, but its weights aren't due until July 27, 2026, so it isn't ranked here yet.

* * *

## What Is an Open-Source LLM?

An open-source large language model is one whose weights are publicly available for download, so you can run it on your own hardware, fine-tune it on your own data, and deploy it without paying per-token API fees. The license determines what you can actually do with it commercially.

The most permissive licenses are MIT and Apache 2.0, which allow unrestricted commercial use. The Llama License (Meta) and Gemma License (Google) are open for most uses but have specific restrictions.

**License types in this guide:**

| License | Commercial Use | Fine-Tuning | Redistribution | Restrictions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **MIT** | Yes | Yes | Yes | None |
| **Apache 2.0** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Attribution required |
| **Llama License** | Yes (under 700M users) | Yes | Yes | Requires Meta approval above threshold |
| **Gemma License** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Prohibits uses that harm Google products |
| **Open Weight** | Varies | Varies | Varies | Check per model |

## What Is Onyx?

[Onyx](https://onyx.app/) is an open-source AI platform that helps teams operationalize open-source and open-weight LLMs. The model provides inference, while Onyx supplies connectors, permission-aware retrieval, AI chat, agents, deep research, and user access across the organization.

That matters because adopting an open model is rarely the end of the project. Teams still need to connect it to Slack, Confluence, Google Drive, Jira, GitHub, and other knowledge sources without breaking access controls. Onyx provides that layer while keeping model choice open.

## Using Open-Source LLMs in Enterprise Workflows

Choosing an MIT or Apache 2.0 model is only part of the decision. Teams also need a way to compare hosted and self-hosted backends, connect those models to internal data, and preserve permissions.

[Onyx](https://onyx.app/) is useful in this context because it gives teams a common application layer on top of open-source models. You can test a hosted API against a self-hosted endpoint, connect the chosen model to sources like Slack, Confluence, Jira, Google Drive, and GitHub, and keep permission-aware retrieval in front of users. That makes it easier to act on the licensing and deployment tradeoffs in this guide instead of evaluating each model in isolation.

* * *

## Recommended Open-Source LLM Stack

| Deployment goal | Recommended setup | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local evaluation | Ollama or LM Studio with a smaller open model | Fastest way to test prompts and fit |
| Production inference | vLLM or SGLang serving an MIT or Apache model | Better throughput and operational control |
| Enterprise knowledge | Onyx connected to the inference endpoint | Adds connectors, permissions, citations, and user access |
| Regulated deployment | Onyx self-hosted + local model + private storage | Keeps data and inference inside the environment |

Pick the model and platform together. A permissive model license is valuable only if the surrounding application layer also supports the deployment and governance requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the best open-source LLM in 2026?

In this leaderboard snapshot, there is no single winner across every benchmark. DeepSeek-V4-Pro leads SWE-bench (80.6%) and LiveCodeBench (93.5%). GLM-5.2 has the highest GPQA Diamond score among the open-weight models listed (91.2%). Kimi K2.6 is close behind on GPQA Diamond (90.5%) while also posting strong BrowseComp and OSWorld agentic scores. The best choice depends on whether you care most about coding, reasoning, licensing, or deployment constraints. Moonshot's Kimi K3 is worth watching too: it's already available via API with an Arena Elo of 1,486, but its weights aren't scheduled to ship until July 27, 2026.

### What is the difference between open-source and open-weight LLMs?

Open-source LLMs have publicly available weights, architecture, and (ideally) training code under a permissive license like MIT or Apache 2.0. Open-weight models release weights but may have proprietary training code or restrictive license terms. In practice, most "open-source" LLMs are open-weight: you can download and run them, but full source code and training data are rarely published.

### Which open-source LLMs can I use commercially?

MIT and Apache 2.0 licensed models allow commercial use without restriction: DeepSeek-V4-Pro, DeepSeek-V4-Flash, GLM-5.2, Hunyuan Hy3, Step-3.7-Flash, Qwen3.6-27B. Kimi K2.6 ships under a Modified MIT license and Nemotron 3 Ultra under Nvidia's OpenMDW-1.1, both of which require reading the specific terms before commercial deployment. MiniMax M3 uses the MiniMax Community license, which has its own commercial-use conditions. Gemma 4 31B uses the Gemma license, which permits commercial use but prohibits uses that harm Google products. Always check the specific license terms for your deployment scenario.

### Can I run these open-source models locally?

Most models in this list require enterprise hardware (4x H100 80GB or more) for full-precision inference, and the largest, like DeepSeek-V4-Pro, GLM-5.2, and Kimi K2.6, need 16x H100 80GB. More accessible options include Qwen3.6-27B and Gemma 4 31B, which both run on a single RTX 4090 24GB. See the [Best Self-Hosted LLMs 2026](https://onyx.app/insights/best-self-hosted-llms-2026) guide for hardware requirements per model.

### What is the best platform for running open-source and proprietary LLMs together?

Most teams end up mixing models: a self-hosted open-weight model for sensitive data, a cheap API for high-volume tasks, and a frontier model for the hardest work. [Onyx](https://onyx.app/) gives teams a single interface to connect all of these, routing tasks to the right model while keeping answers grounded in company knowledge from Slack, Confluence, Jira, Google Drive, and GitHub. It's MIT-licensed, supports self-hosted and API-based backends, and is free to get started.
