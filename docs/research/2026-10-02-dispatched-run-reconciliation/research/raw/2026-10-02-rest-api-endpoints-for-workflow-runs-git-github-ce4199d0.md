In this article

 The REST API is now versioned. For more information, see "[About API versioning](/rest/overview/api-versions)."



# REST API endpoints for workflow runs

 Use the REST API to interact with workflow runs in GitHub Actions.



## [About workflow runs in GitHub Actions](#about-workflow-runs-in-github-actions)

 You can use the REST API to view, re-run, cancel, and view logs for workflow runs in GitHub Actions. A workflow run is an instance of your workflow that runs when the pre-configured event occurs. For more information, see [Managing workflow runs](/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs).



## [Re-run a job from a workflow run](#re-run-a-job-from-a-workflow-run)

 Re-run a job and its dependent jobs in a workflow run.

 OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.

### [Fine-grained access tokens for "Re-run a job from a workflow run"](#re-run-a-job-from-a-workflow-run--fine-grained-access-tokens)

 This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types :


- [GitHub App user access tokens](/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app)
- [GitHub App installation access tokens](/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-an-installation-access-token-for-a-github-app)
- [Fine-grained personal access tokens](/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)

 The fine-grained token must have the following permission set:


- "Actions" repository permissions (write)

### [Fine-grained access tokens for "List workflow runs for a workflow"](#list-workflow-runs-for-a-workflow--fine-grained-access-tokens)

 This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types :


- [GitHub App user access tokens](/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app)
- [GitHub App installation access tokens](/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-an-installation-access-token-for-a-github-app)
- [Fine-grained personal access tokens](/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)

 The fine-grained token must have the following permission set:


- "Actions" repository permissions (read)

 This endpoint can be used without authentication or the aforementioned permissions if only public resources are requested.
